This repository demonstrates using the https://toolkit.phdata.io[phData Toolkit CLI] with CICD, targeting a Snowflake account.

Each tool has its own project directory named respectively.
Most of the link:.github/workflows[workflows] run on a schedule, or can be manually run.
The link:.github/workflows/provision.yaml[Provision workflow] runs for each PR containing changes to the link:provision[provision] directory, and then again on merge to master.
